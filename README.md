This repository demonstrates a bug in a JavaScript function designed to perform a deep comparison of two objects. The function correctly compares objects with nested objects but fails when those objects contain arrays.  The bug is in the handling of array comparisons within the recursive function. The solution provides a corrected version that handles arrays accurately.  This is a common issue when implementing deep comparison algorithms in JavaScript.
